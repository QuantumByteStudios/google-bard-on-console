  Ingredients  

  1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
  1 teaspoon baking powder
  1/2 teaspoon baking soda
  1/2 teaspoon salt
  1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
  3/4 cup granulated sugar
  3/4 cup packed light brown sugar
  2 large eggs
  1 teaspoon vanilla extract
  1 cup milk

  Instructions  

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch baking pan.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
3. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the brown sugar until well combined. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients alternately with the milk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Stir until just combined.
4. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 25-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool completely before frosting.
